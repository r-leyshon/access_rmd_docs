## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plt <- ggplot(pressure, aes(x = pressure, y = temperature)) +
  geom_point()
access_img(alt = "Plot of pressure vs temperature.")
```

## Including Images from disk

`r access_img(img = "../www/then-and-now-carole-hersee.jpeg",
           alt = "BBC Test card then and now.", wid = 800, ht = 450)`
  </body>
