#### 'ptspotter' Package

[![CRAN status](https://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/ptspotter)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ptspotter) [![R build status](https://github.com/r-leyshon/ptspotter/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/r-leyshon/ptspotter/actions) ![Codecov test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/r-leyshon/ptspotter/graph/badge.svg)
[![CRAN RStudio mirror downloads](https://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/grand-total/ptspotter?color=blue)](https://r-pkg.org/pkg/ptspotter)

'ptspotter' is a package that aims to simplify some of the mundane tasks
involved in setting up an analytical pipeline using the fantastic [ProjectTemplate](http://projecttemplate.net/) framework.

[ptspotter is available on CRAN.](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ptspotter)

#### Highways England Traffic Data

<img src="../www/road_data.png" alt="Road data application interface." height = 400>


This data pipeline was redeveloped in December 2020 as Brexit approached. It has
been an important source of road sensor data to help inform the movement of
traffic around English ports. This redevelopment was requested by the faster
economic indicators team.

The redeveloped pipeline features the querying of the Highways England RESTful
webTRIS api in parallel using a virtual environment. Additional value beyond the
MVP was added with a Shiny UI to add data validation and an automated Rmarkdown
report adding insight on the proportion of site types returning null responses.

### Shiny Applications{.tabset}

These applications are presented in reverse order of publication. While the
contexts of the applications vary, they help to illustrate an increasing
maturity in Shiny development.


#### Unifyr

This is an educational application designed to help trainee data scientists in
developing their understanding of the different data join functions available
within the {dplyr} package. Unifyr allows the learner to select subsets from the
well-known gapminder dataset and observe the output of specified join functions.

#### Google Mobility Data

This Google Mobility Data application was developed at the start of the Covid-19
pandemic using data derived by the optical processing of pdf data publications, 
an innovative approach to improving the accessibility of Google's publications.

The application allows the user to select specified local authority or NHS
bodies in order to view the time series mobility data.

#### Welsh School Funding

This application combines 2 open datasets published by Welsh Government:
Budgeted educational revenue and outturn expenditure. The available data
dimensions may be selected from to plot upon the chart axes by educational
phase. Time series data for all available schools and data dimensions may also 
be viewed upon the second tab.

#### Common Welsh Place Names

This app was a bit of fun and took very little time. It used some basic language
processing and geolocation to plot Welsh location names with common prefixes 
such as "Cwm" or "Aber" on a map. The application used open data published by
the Welsh Language Commissioner who subsequently approached me to share the
application codebase with them.

#### Cardiff Tide Levels

This repo visualises LiDar altitude data of Cardiff openly published by Natural
Resources Wales. Cardiff was selected due to comparatively high data quality and
population density. The visualisations compare current day high tide altitude
with a modelled 2 metre sea rise by the year 2100.

#### Remote Sensing Trees

In 2018 I had been approached by a colleague to discuss the feasibility of using
satellite data to help estimate the quantity of woodland stock in a defined
rural area. The report documents my exploration work done in this area using
open source geospatial frameworks and satellite rasters. The work pointed to 
a promising avenue of analysis but also indicated limitations in the use of open
source landsat imagery. At the time I recommended the procurement of higher
resolution remote imagery and verification of tree counts using ground truth
observational work.

#### Welsh Schools Funding 18/19

This {flexdashboard} user interface was one of my first pieces of work in
application development. The dashboard is an adapted RMarkdown output and can 
very easily be reproduced with some basic data manipulation and markdown syntax.
Furthermore, the product is self-contained and can be Emailed and freely shared,
unlike a Shiny application which requires a connection to R and a shiny server.

The dashboard presents Budgeted Education Revenue for financial years 2018/19.
An interactive map of geolocated schools in Wales is presented with informative
tooltips highlighting the data dimensions. In additional tabs, linear regression
models of pupil numbers against delegated budgets for each educational phase are
presented.
