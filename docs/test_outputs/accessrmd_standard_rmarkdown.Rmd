## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see [RStudio's Rmarkdown guidance](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plt <- ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + geom_point()
access_img(plt, alt = "Vapour pressure of mercury as a product of temperature",
           wid = 500)

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## A tabset to test {.tabset}


### Section 1

Sample text. Testing **bold**.

### Section 2

More Sample text

```{r}
x <- as.data.frame(rnorm(300))
plt <- ggplot(x, aes(x[, 1])) + geom_density()
access_img(
  plt,
  alt = "Density plot of a sample taken from a normal distribution",
  ht = 500)
```


### Section 3

Yet more sample text

```{r}
# some code comments to check
vec <- c(runif(100))
# Some output to check
summary(vec)

```


## The next header cancels the tabset

There doesn't appear to be an accordion feature native to Rmarkdown.
